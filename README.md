# EmuGUI
What should I say? I didn't like the existing QEMU interfaces for Windows, so I made my own.

## System requirements
OS: Windows 8.1 or later (x64), Debian 11, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Fedora 34, RHEL 7, openSUSE Leap 15.3, Arch or equivalent Linux systems (x64)

Python: 3.6 or newer

Processor: x64 Dual Core Processor with @2.6 GHz¹

RAM: 6 GB¹

HDD: 2 GB¹

¹ This is the absolute minimum, the required performance depends on the operating system system you want to run.
